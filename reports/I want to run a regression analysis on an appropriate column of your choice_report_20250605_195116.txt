## Analysis Report: Regression Analysis on 'AMT_CREDIT'

### Task Type:
I conducted a regression analysis to predict the 'AMT_CREDIT' using appropriate columns from the dataset.

### Dataset Overview:
The dataset contains 307511 rows and 122 columns. The goal is to predict 'AMT_CREDIT' using structured data features.

### Methodology:
I employed Linear Regression for the analysis. The dataset was divided into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

### Model Metrics:
The model's performance metrics are as follows:
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 67442.582
- R-squared (R²): 0.979

### Feature Insights:
The most influential features affecting 'AMT_CREDIT' prediction are:
- YEARS_BEGINEXPLUATATION_AVG
- CODE_GENDER_XNA
- APARTMENTS_AVG
- YEARS_BEGINEXPLUATATION_MODE
- APARTMENTS_MEDI

### Summary (in plain language):
The model can effectively predict 'AMT_CREDIT' based on the dataset features. Lower RMSE and higher R² values indicate accurate predictions. Notable features influencing the prediction include 'YEARS_BEGINEXPLUATATION_AVG', 'CODE_GENDER_XNA', 'APARTMENTS_AVG', 'YEARS_BEGINEXPLUATATION_MODE', and 'APARTMENTS_MEDI'.

### Technical Summary:
The model was trained using scikit-learn's LinearRegression on standardized and encoded input features.

### Limitations and Notes:
- Any limitations or additional notes about the analysis could be included here.
